Django Vendor
=============

Django App Toolkit for selling digital and physical goods online.


Goals of the project:
- Drop in to existing Django Sites without requiring changes to how Django works (flow, not fight)
- Handle everything from the point of starting a purchase, until payment is complete.
- BYOPM, Bring Your Own Product Model.  Subclass your Product Model off of our base model and add whatever you want.  You are responsible for things like Catalogs and Presenting products to the user, we handle the purchasing of the products and generate a reciept you can look for.
